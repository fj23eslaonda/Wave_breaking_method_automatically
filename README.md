# Installation
To use the Duck model it is necessary to install specific packages. Therefore, it is recommended to create a virtual environment to install the packages.


Install Virtual Environment 
```
sudo apt install python3-venv
```
Create Virtual Environment 
```
python3 -m venv my-project-env
```
Activate environment and install packages
```
source my-project-env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Use Duck model
```
cd REPO_ROOT_DIR
sh prediction_model.sh
```
**if you have larger images than 512x512 pixels you need to modify upsize_image and downsize_img functions in main.py**
